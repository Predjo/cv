It was during my one day in London. I was bored waiting for my flight, so I walked around the town and found a salsa club. At first it was a typical, but after a while I found a girl that was able to follow me. We started dancing and people thought we were so good that they moved around to give us space and made a circle around us. We even got a clap at the end. IT WAS AWESOME!!",
